### **Todo Randomizer: Changes and Improvements**

Here’s a summary of the changes made to the Todo Randomizer app, along with their impact, difficulty level, and justification for prioritization:

---

### **Completed Tasks**
1. **Add `style.css` to the HTML File**  
   - **What Changed**: Linked the CSS file to the HTML using `<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">`.  
   - **Difficulty**: Easy (1 minute).  
   - **Why I Did It Second**: This was a quick fix that immediately improved the app’s layout and usability. Without it, the UI was unstyled and harder to navigate.  

2. **Prevent Page Reload on "Add"**  
   - **What Changed**: Added `event.preventDefault()` to the `addToList` function to stop the form from reloading the page.  
   - **Difficulty**: Easy (2 minutes).  
   - **Why I Did It First**: This was a critical bug that made the app unusable. Fixing it ensured the app retained its state and functioned as intended.  

3. **Add an Error for Empty Input on "Add"**  
   - **What Changed**: Added a check to ensure the textarea isn’t empty before adding items (`if (!list.value.trim())`).  
   - **Difficulty**: Moderate (5 minutes).  
   - **Why I Did It Third**: This validation prevents invalid submissions and ensures the todo list only contains meaningful items. It’s a core usability improvement.  

4. **Show an Error if the List is Empty on Randomization**  
   - **What Changed**: Added a check to ensure the list isn’t empty before randomizing (`if (toDoList.length === 0)`).  
   - **Difficulty**: Moderate (5 minutes).  
   - **Why I Did It Fourth**: This prevents `undefined` results and provides clear feedback when the list is empty. It’s essential for a good user experience.  
   - **Why I Used an Alert**: A more advanced solution (e.g., toast notifications or inline error messages in red) would require additional HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. While this would provide a better user experience, it was deprioritized due to time constraints. The alert is a quick, functional solution that meets the core requirement. 

5. **Clear Textarea After Adding Items**  
   - **What Changed**: Set `list.value = ''` after processing the input.  
   - **Difficulty**: Easy (1 minute).  
   - **Why I Did It Fifth**: This small change improves the workflow by providing visual confirmation that items were added. It’s a quick win for usability.  

6. **Add Remove Functionality**  
   - **What Changed**: Added a "Remove" button next to each item in the list to allow users to delete tasks.  
   - **Difficulty**: Moderate (10 minutes).  
   - **Why I Did It Sixth**: This feature makes the app more interactive and practical for ongoing use. It’s a valuable addition but not as critical as the earlier fixes.  

7. **On Large Screens, Center Content with White Space**  
   - **What Changed**: Added a `max-width` to the `#root` container and used `margin: 0 auto` to center it on large screens.  
   - **Difficulty**: Easy (3 minutes).  
   - **Why I Did It Seventh**: This styling enhancement improves the app’s appearance on wider screens, making it look more polished and professional.

### **Incomplete Tasks**
1. **Improve Formatting of the List**  
   - **Why It Wasn’t Done**: The list is functional but lacks advanced formatting (e.g., bullet points, better spacing). This was considered a polish task and deferred.  

2. **Style the Page Further**  
   - **Why It Wasn’t Done**: While the app has a clean, dark theme, additional styling (e.g., animations, toast notifications, inline error messages, advanced layouts) was deprioritized to focus on functionality.  

---

### **Impact of Changes**
The app is now fully functional, user-friendly, and visually cohesive. Key improvements include:
- **State Retention**: The app no longer reloads, preserving the todo list.  
- **Validation**: Users receive clear feedback for empty inputs or lists.  
- **Dynamic List Management**: Users can add and remove items, making the app more practical.  
- **Modern Design**: The dark theme, responsive layout, and centered content on large screens enhance the overall user experience.

### **Why This Order?**
- **Fixes First**: Addressed critical bugs (page reload, missing CSS) to ensure the app works as intended.  
- **Validation Next**: Added checks for empty input and lists to prevent errors and improve user experience.  
- **UX Improvements**: Cleared the textarea and added remove functionality to make the app more interactive.  
- **Styling Enhancements**: Centered content on large screens for a polished look, but deferred advanced formatting and additional styling.
