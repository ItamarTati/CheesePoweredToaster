To improve the application, adding unit tests would be a valuable step to ensure core functionality works as intended. This includes testing random number generation, command parsing, and handling invalid inputs. Strong test coverage will help catch edge cases and improve reliability.

The applicationâ€™s error handling can also be enhanced by providing clearer error messages and validating inputs like dice size and count to prevent unexpected behavior. Additionally, replacing System.out.println with a logging framework like SLF4J would improve maintainability and give better control over log levels.

Introducing features such as an exit command for ending the session and improved error messages for unsupported command formats would further enhance the user experience. These updates would make the tool more intuitive and professional.
