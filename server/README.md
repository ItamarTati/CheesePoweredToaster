To further improve the application, unit tests should be added to ensure the core functionality works as expected. This includes testing random number generation, command parsing, and error handling for invalid inputs. Proper test coverage will help catch edge cases and ensure reliability.

The code can be enhanced by improving error handling and input validation. For example, providing clearer error messages and ensuring inputs like dice size and count are valid. Additionally, replacing `System.out.println` with a logging framework like SLF4J would make the application more maintainable and professional.
